Snippets for Visual Studio
============================================
To Add a Code Snippet to Visual Studio

1. You can add your own snippets to your Visual Studio installation by using the Code Snippets Manager. Open the Code Snippets Manager (Tools/Code Snippets Manager).

2. Click the Import button.

3. Go to the location where you saved the code snippet in the previous procedure, select it, and click Open.

4. The Import Code Snippet dialog opens, asking you to choose where to add the snippet from the choices in the right pane. One of the choices should be My Code Snippets. Select it and click Finish, then OK.

5. The snippet is copied to the following location:
%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Visual Studio Dev11\Code Snippets\Visual Basic\My Code Snippets

6. Test your snippet by opening a Visual Basic project and opening a code file. In the file click Insert Snippet on the context menu, then My Code Snippets. You should see a snippet named My Visual Basic Code Snippet. Double-click it.
